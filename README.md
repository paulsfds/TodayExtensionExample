# Tech talk on how to build an iOS Today Extension
I gave a tech talk on how to build an iOS Today Extension for
a weather app and this is the sample project. Here are the slides:
https://prezi.com/vbnyzopkpgtz/creating-a-today-extension-for-ios/.

# Requirements
- Weather Underground API Key (or you can use mine)
- iOS Developer Account

# Setup
- Create a new application in your developer account and enable
App Groups. You can create your own or use the one I used in the app,
which is "group.FunnyOrDie.TechTalk".
